# System Performance Simulation
## Overview
This project demonstrates system performance modeling and simulation, designed as a portfolio-ready artifact for software and systems engineering roles. It simulates the response of a simple first-order system to different input scenarios, generates visual outputs (graphs), and produces logs summarizing system behavior. The project reflects workflows commonly used in defense and aerospace engineering: modeling, simulation, analysis, and documentation of system performance.
## Features
- Deterministic system modeling for reproducible results
- Two input scenarios:
  - Sinusoidal input (oscillatory behavior)
  - Step input (sudden change response)
- System output visualization using Matplotlib
- Comprehensive logs summarizing numerical results
- Folder structure that mimics professional engineering artifacts
## Skills Highlighted
- Python programming for system modeling and simulation
- Data analysis and visualization with NumPy and Matplotlib
- Software documentation and artifact generation
- Reproducible workflows suitable for Linux or cross-platform environments
- Understanding of system dynamics and response analysis
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ installed
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SystemPerformanceSimulation.git
cd SystemPerformanceSimulation
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Running the Simulation:
```bash
python system_performance_simulation.py
```
## Artifacts
The project generates professional-quality artifacts suitable for inclusion in a portfolio or technical documentation:
- **Graphs** – Visually show system input vs output for different scenarios
- **Logs** – Document numerical results, including mean, min, and max output values
- **Structured code** – Clear, commented Python script following best practices
## Notes
- This simulation is fully deterministic, ensuring reproducible results for review and assessment
- Designed to demonstrate capabilities aligned with software and systems engineering tasks, such as those in aerospace and defense programs
- The methodology can be expanded to include stochastic inputs, multiple system configurations, or more complex modeling for advanced portfolio entries
